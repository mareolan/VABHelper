VABHelper
=========

Plugin for Kerbal Space Program (https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/). The plugin adds these functionalities to the game:
* When constructing spacecraft / aircraft - a menu with a list of parts can be shown by Control+Shift+Click so that it's possible to detach any of them (regardless of z-index). The shortcut is configurable.

The plugin was created and tested using KSP v0.23. The source code was created using Visual Studio Express 2013.
